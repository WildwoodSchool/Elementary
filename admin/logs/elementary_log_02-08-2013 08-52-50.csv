He is a capable student who shows examples of his abilities and quest for knowledge in our group discussions, yet at times produces assignments that do not reflect his capabilities. When redirected by a teacher, he will re-do or correct his work, but we would like to see Hudson be more responsible about self-editing and correcting and even better, putting forth a little more effort into his initial efforts to avoid having to fix what are very often just careless errors or sloppy work. In the classroom, we observe Hudson being cooperative and flexible in partnerships and in group work. On Big Yard, Hudson can be found playing a fast-paced football or soccer game with his friends. He is fair-minded and compassionate, always quick to check on a friend if they are hurt or injured.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-26 21:34:59"

He is now beginning to use more reading strategies and knows when something does not make sense. *more from assessment</p>
<p>Henry has improved a great deal in Writing Workshop! He is now including more details in his stories, and is taking more time with his work. Henry sometimes needs teacher reminders to include illustrations with his words, and in coming months will work on revising and editing his stories. In Word Work, Henry is working on solidifying blends and digraphs (sh, st, br) and on beginning long vowel patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry sometimes needs reminders to listen while others are talking, and occassionally needs to clarify comments he makes since they seem off topic.&nbsp;</p>

In writing, Hudson has very little difficulty getting started. Once he gets immersed in a piece of writing he writes with purpose and focus. Hudson enjoyed doing research on the Giant Ground Sloth of the La Brea Tar Pits. He was able to turn his fact fragments into complete sentences and a finally two paragraphs complete with topic sentences and a conclusion. &nbsp;He is able to use teacher feedback to improve his writing, and will try out suggestions and different approaches during the revision process.

Students reflect on their own knowledge by comparing and contrasting their answers with answers that get shared by their classmates. This 'discovery' that recognizes that there is value in more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different numbers. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension.</p>
<p>Hudson is a capable mathematician who has great number sense and strong math skills. Hudson participates often during math group. He willingly shares his strategies and can explain his thinking clearly. Hudson will continue to develop and practice using the multiplication squares to help him when computing 2 and 3 digit multiplication problems. In addition to multiplication, Hudson is working on regrouping in addition up to the 100,000.

He is a capable student who shows examples of his abilities and quest for knowledge in our group discussions, yet at times produces assignments that do not reflect his capabilities. When redirected by a teacher, he will re-do or correct his work, but we would like to see Hudson be more responsible about self-editing and correcting and even better, putting forth a little more effort into his initial efforts to avoid having to fix what are very often just careless errors or sloppy work. In the classroom, we observe Hudson being cooperative and flexible in partnerships and in group work. On Big Yard, Hudson can be found playing a fast-paced football or soccer game with his friends. He is fair-minded and compassionate, always quick to check on a friend if they are hurt or injured.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-27 21:14:06"

<p>- Kyle is inconsistent in the effort he puts forward. Some days, he is inspired and proud of his work, and other days, he uses the word 'can't', says 'I don't know' when we ask questions, and rushes through his work, doodles on his page, and can miss the point of an assignment. (for example, the show not tell writing assignment- first draft day)</p>
<p>- His handwriting needs improvement, as does his written organizational skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-During quiet reading time, Kyle often uses a full voice as he reads aloud to himself. We are helping him understand that this may be distracting to others, and that, although it's okay to do his silent reading with a low hum or whisper, he will have to lower his voice in a group setting.</p>
<p>- Kyle has been doing a terrific job with his reading homework, and this is leading to improvements in his skills.</p>

<p>- Very very recently (<em>Sarah, we talked about this</em>) Lily seems very aware of other's feelings towards her and feels uncomfortable when she assumes that other's are taking about her, etc. One example is when she asked to changed her clothing because another child told her she has triangles on her bottom.

<p>- Socially- Sophia is well-liked and has many friends. She can be found on big yard playing games with her girl friends and smiling and laughing.

<p>- Her handwriting is gorgeous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When she puts the effort forth, her writing is solid, but I think she may be capable of more on a regular basis.

<p>We have seen some growth in Alexandra's reading. Her fluency has improved, however, she still tends to gloss over words that she doesn't know, and in its place, substitute a word that does not fit the context of the story. When reading with Alexandra, we&nbsp;suggest strategies that can help her decode the unknown word. &nbsp;We practice the following strategies with Alexandra: &nbsp;sounding out, covering the word and thinking about what word would fit the sentence that begins with the first sound, and slowing down and trying to self-correct the substituted word. &nbsp;We also encourage Alexandra to recognize &nbsp;puntutation in the passage that she's reading. &nbsp;This helps her with comprehending big and little ideas.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-28 09:53:16"

<p>-Bee is a solid member of our classroom communinty. She takes her role as a group member very seriously and treats others with fairness and kindness. She has a terrific sense of humor. She's creative and expressive in her language and writing. It's a joy to hear her thoughts in group discussions.</p>
<p>- Bee still struggles with anxiety in the classroom from time to time. We've noticed that these anxious moments usually come when Bee is not reaching goals she has seemed to set for herself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Bee has made huge social leaps this semester. She's taken risks, initiated social interactions (like writing/directing the play) and there has been great payoff in her efforts. On BY, she is found playing with a group of girls, laughing, running, playing! She has also been better about expressing her needs to teachers.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-28 11:43:54"

She is a determined student who can read entire books independently. Charlie likes to be challenged and does not shy away from books that are higher than her 'Just Right' level. Charlie knows her beginning, ending, and short vowel sounds. She uses phonetic skills, context clues, and the illustrations to decode unknown words. Charlie is also building her sight word repertoire which is making her a more fluent reader. During Reading Workshop, Charlie reads with her partner, can retell details from what she reads, and makes connections to other aspects of her life. We are proud of Charlie's dedication to reading and thrilled to see how much she has learned!</p>
<p>Charlie is excelling in Writing Workshop. Our most recent unit on Non-fiction allowed her to showcase how she has grown as an author. Charlie understands the importance of brainstorming before beginning to write. She chooses appropriate topics she can knowledgeably write about. Her thoughts are organized and follow the pattern of story telling. She is an impressive Brave Speller who does not allow concerns about conventional spelling stop her from using higher level words.

Students reflect on their own knowledge by comparing and contrasting their answers with answers that get shared by their classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different numbers. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension.</p>

We have been working on the same number combinations, using subtraction. &nbsp;With practice, Alexandra can become facile with these combinations. &nbsp;We encourage her to do the Xtra Math program, on the computer for five minutes a day. &nbsp;Alexandra has more difficulty with story problems. &nbsp;She has to read the problem and understand what set of operations to use.

When solving problems, Sophia chooses strategies based on her good understanding of place value and known number combinations, which is one of the necessary skills to be able to successfully learn regrouping with addition. &nbsp;Sophia is a joy to teach!</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-30 15:36:43"

She is a capable student who shows examples of her abilities and quest for knowledge, yet she tends to produce assignments that do not reflect these abilities. When redirected by a teacher, she will re-do or correct her work, but we would like to see her be more responsible about self-editing and correcting and even better, putting a little more effort into her initial efforts to avoid having to fix what are very often just careless errors or sloppy work. Socially, Pai is a good friend. She is well liked by her peers. Out on the yard, she shows a sense of fairness and treats her classmates in a kind and thoughtful way. In the classroom, we observe her being cooperative and flexible in partnerships or in group work.

She arrives to school each day ready to participate, and share a story. Anouska started the year with many friends in our classroom and is working to develop new friendships as well. She has a strong desire to know what is going on with others around her, and at times she continues conversations with peers after others have transitioned to the next activity. We would like to see her work on limiting those side conversations and choosing more appropriate moments to have them. Anouska is a well-rounded student. She takes her own achievements seriously and works to contribute in conversations. Her homework is consistent, however we would like to see her put forth more effort on neatness and content. We would also like to see her continue to push herself, particularly in the academic areas where she does not feel as successful.

Spelling is a stretch for Anouska, but she willingly uses a dictionary during the revision process. She uses her Writer&rsquo;s Workshop time effectively, and there are plenty of opportunities for growth in our writing curriculum. Anouska is a very engaged book group member as the smaller groups are more comfortable and it is easier to express her ideas. Here she shares her thoughts and opinions with a bit more confidence.

We are very proud of Corinna.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corinna has blossomed as an author. She began the year telling her stories through illustrations. Corinna now feels confident using her 'Brave Spelling' to add sentences to each page she writes. &nbsp;Corinna knows her beginning and end sounds and is working on her short vowels. She understands the writing process and can brainstorm, organize, and then write her ideas. Corinna feels good about her writing and loves to share her work when she is done. Her book about 'How to Finger Knit' showed her ability to write both factually and creatively.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=3;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-31 09:29:25"

She is beginning to move away from direct modeling and 'counting on' and starting to incorporate her knowledge of doubles facts and place value to solve single and double digit addition and subtraction problems. Nita is also beginning to experiment with base ten blocks, and is using them to add double digits and create an 'invented algorithm.' (23+35 = 20+30 and 3+5). She sometimes still seems confused when articulating her thinking, but has improved greatly in this area.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-31 15:52:55"

Bryce uses the pictures to help her understand the story. She is tracking each word and using her phonetic skills to decode grade level words. A goal for Bryce is to read her 'Just Right' books with her reading partner multiple times. Often they will finish reading their book quickly but will guess on a lot of the words rather than using the tools we are working on. When Bryce reads with a teacher she remembers to use these tools. We would like to see Bryce feel more confident to participate during read aloud because we know she has great ideas to share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryce has shown growth in both the quality and quantity of her written work. Bryce understands the craft of story telling including characters, plot, and setting. Recently, in our Non-fiction unit Bryce showed her strength in using her illustrations to tell a story. She drew beautifully detailed pictures for her book titled, 'How To Be A Good Friend.' Bryce then went through her book and added words to each page. She is becoming a fantastic Brave Speller! Bryce knows her beginning and ending sounds and is beginning to master her short vowel sounds.

She follows directions and is a fantastic role model for her peers. Charlie is an amazing problem solver. She can logically and compassionately navigate the normal Kindergarten social situations with ease.

He loves to laugh and have fun with his friends. He is well liked by his peers. At times, while pursuing an opportunity to laugh, he can become distracted from his work in class. We would like to see Ikey continue to work on recognizing appropriate moments to be silly. Ikey has already made a lot of progress this year in recognizing his academic potential. His homework is more consistently completed and turned in on time. He also pushes himself to work towards his personal best. Ikey is bright, and very capable, and we would like to encourage him to persevere even when his work is difficult. He is a pleasure to have in class and we look forward to participating in his continued growth this year!</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-01 12:50:52"

Ikey is working on elaborating his ideas in his writing pieces by using the writing tools he has learned. At times, he is challenged by a new writing assignment, and we would like to see him work on prewriting before starting a new story. He is learning how to actively use writer&rsquo;s tools to help add depth to his writing. There are ample opportunities for growth in Ikey&rsquo;s writing, and we will use the Writer&rsquo;s Workshop process to aid him in his development.

Using a graphic organizer to prewrite helps lay a foundation for his ideas, which will ensure that his stories are focused and easier to write. The revision process can be challenging for young writers, but Jake uses the opportunity to develop as a writer. There will be ample time for Jake to practice his writing strategies throughout the year, and we will be there to support him. Jake is an avid reader, and willingly shares his enthusiasm for literature with his teachers and peers. In book group, Jake adds his ideas and opinions willingly. Although Jake is eager to participate in this book group, he struggles to put forth the necessary time and effort to thoroughly complete his book group preparation. He will continue to develop as a reader by working to complete the homework assignments designed to help him recognize story clues and sequence of events in his reading.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-01 14:37:39"

He is willing to put forth the effort to be successful, and is able to work independently when he understands how to solve a problem. At times, he wants to rush through his work to move on to the number sets he thinks are more difficult which causes him to make careless mistakes. If he continues to practice with simpler number sets, he can ensure he is solving the problems correctly before moving on. We would also like to see him master his multiplication facts as this would ensure more success in his work. Nathan has already grown a lot as a math student this year and we look forward to watching his math confidence continue to rise throughout the school year.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-01 14:55:56"

He has a lot of ideas and topics that he wants to write about. We would like to see him continue to grow in his ability to take his thoughts and organize them into a story. This does not come easily to Nathan, and it can take him a long time to create a first draft. As is his personality, he perseveres and is learning to use his writing tools to make revisions. Also we have found that the use of a graphic organizer to help him get started lays the foundation for an organized story. We will continue to help him develop in this area. In book group, Nathan participates with enthusiasm. He enjoys the books and the discussions, and has clearly put forth the effort on his prep sheet to participate during the discussion in a meaningful way.

She picks up patterns in books quickly. A goal for Addison is to work on retelling what she read in detail. We are confident this will happen as she becomes a more fluent reader because right now her focus is just on getting the words correct. Addison is exactly where she should be with her reading!</p>
<p>Addison began the year telling her stories through pictures. She is now adding words and even sentences to her stories! We have also seen Addison branch out in the topics she choses to write about. The Non-Fiction unit has been a great chance for Addison to learn about a new writing style. Addison likes to finish things quickly so we frequently ask her to go back and add more details to her pictures or words. When Addison is finished writing one of her pieces she absolutely lights up with excitement! A goal for Addison is to remember to capitalize 'I'. She is doing a beautiful job in her writing and we are so proud of her Brave Spelling abilities!&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-02 08:51:15"

He recognizes all his letters. He is working hard to learn all his letter sounds. Colin can pick up the pattern in a book and use it to read. Colin also uses the pictures to tell the story. Colin greatly benefits from one on one support when he and his reading partner read a book. &nbsp;A goal for Colin is to become a more independent reader with his 'Just Right' books. We are confident this will happen as he become a more confident reader. Colin has shown great growth with ryhming words!</p>
<p>Colin is blossoming author who uses his pictures to tell a story. He enjoys writing about his favorite topics which include his family and specifically his baby sister Parker. With teacher support Colin can tell a story sequentially using pictures and words. Some letter sound present a challenge in his writing such as 'L, H, F, and G'. This is expected for our kindergartners. A goal for Colin is to take the lessons we are teaching during Writing Workshop and apply them to his own writing. We are proud of his effort and hard work.&nbsp;</p>

She is a compassionate child who knows how to use her words to express exactly what she is feeling or thinking. It is key that she uses her words instead of her body when she is frustrated. Esme is working on impulse control as she often calls out or talks to her friends during circle time. She will also lose focus if a discussion last more than a couple minutes and will then want to lay on the floor. We would love to see her more engaged and actively participating. When she does raise her hand to say something it is accurate so we know she is listening and making connections. &nbsp;Esme benefits greatly from one on one support. She is producing much higher level work and learning to take her time. Esme has made connections in class and loves her peers. A goal for Esme is to not grab her friends or use her body in an agressive way. When she does so her peers become frustrated with her. She is amazingly kind and helpful to her teachers. Esme is also very friendly and likes to talk to new people whether they are her peers or faculty members. Esme still needs consistent reminders on how to actively listen.

Students also learned about different types of homes and the architectural process. After drawing a design of his/her home, each student created a structure for their clay family to live using wood. Our classroom discussions delved in to the essential questions of, &ldquo;What does a home need?&rdquo;; &ldquo;What makes your family unique?&rdquo;;&nbsp; and &ldquo;What does your home and family provide for you?&rdquo;.&nbsp; From these discussions topics such as adoption, homelessness, and differences within and between families have arisen.

<p>Writing is a strength for Jacob. Jacob always strives to do his best on each writing project. He takes the skils we are teach and uses them in his daily writing. His writing can be both creative and informative. Jacob is using complex sentence and proper punctuation. He enjoys when his work is shared out loud. Jacob's 'All About Presidents' book wowed us.

It took a bit of time for these distinctive traits to fully emerge, as Amelia does not frequently tend to share or participate in discussions. Amelia began submitting well-constructed writing pieces and making reading response notations that demonstrated her writing strengths and her ability to analyze and synthesize information. As a result, we recognized how capable she is; however, she continued to be quite reserved in most discussions and group work and without teacher support, she rarely volunteers to speak.&nbsp; We would like to see her trust in herself and develop some strategies to go outside her comfort zone and take some risks to join in with the group.&nbsp; While Amelia is certainly kind and cooperative in her interactions, we would like to see her contribute her thoughts more freely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Amelia is capable of being a focused reader. She comprehends what she has read and can thoughtfully reflect upon it. She has an eye for detail and catches nuances in the text that are sophisticated and require her to think on a deeper level.

Bobby sometimes has trouble making inferences in books, and is unclear how a character may be feeling if it is not directly state in the text. Bobby is also an independent and prolific writer. He continues to work on conventional spelling patters and punctuation, but is retaining new patterns such as silent e, and some long vowel patterns.

Natalie has an excellet letter/sound awareness, and is able to self-correct when something does not make sense as she reads. She has good comprehension skills and will often respond audibly while reading, making connections to her life. Natalie is an independent writer who readily tries to incorporate new writing tools into her stories. In her recent story about ballet, Natalie included detailed illustrations with perspective and showing movement, as well as punctuation. In Word Work, Natalie has an excellent grasp of short vowels, blends, and digraphs (sh, br), and is working on beginning long vowel patterns such as ai, ea, and ee. Natalie is a respectful listener who seems to enjoy sharing news about her life during Morning Meetings.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-03 09:30:36"

Sometimes Ruby needs reminders to trust herself and listen fully to directions or information so that she has time to process it fully before assuming that she will not understand. &nbsp;Ruby expresses her feelings openly with friends when she is in conflict with them. At times Ruby ends up 'tattling' on friends before going to them to problem solve. &nbsp;She responds well to reminders to deal directly with friends before going to get help from teachers.

<p>Cash is showing strong progress as a writer. He puts effort into his illustrations, is consistently leaving spaces between words and is experimenting with lowercase letters.

<p>One area where we will continue to support Ava is in using an age appropriate voice to express her thoughts and needs.

Jack is a supportive reading partner who is consistently on task. His comprehensions is remarkable. He makes connections to other things he knows about and is always excited to share his comments on the readings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jack understands the concepts we teach in Writing Workshop. He can write both fiction and non fiction pieces in a detailed and organized fashion. Jack writes about things he knows and is passionate about. He can cleverly use humor to make his writing fun to read. You can hear Jack's voice when you read his writing.

He often thrives during open-ended assignments, such as using Venn Diagrams to compare and contrast communities or characters. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

While her comments and questions are often very thoughtful, she continues to need reminders to raise her hand before speaking.&nbsp; Annabelle&nbsp;can also become silly or shares unrelated comments in what seems as a way to gain attention from her peers.&nbsp; She responds respectfully to reminders, but does need them often.</p>
<p>Annabelle demonstrates a great love of reading. She makes connections between her personal life and the texts she reads, as well as connections from one text to another.&nbsp;&nbsp; She reads fluently and with good expression. Her comprehension is strong, retelling main events and capturing important details. We are encouraging her to remember to turn in her reading log each week as this is an important 2nd grade responsibility.</p>
<p>Annabelle's writing skills are strong. &nbsp;She has good stamina and stays focused on one piece of writing for a long period of time. Her stories contain details and she understands how to take a piece of writing through the writing process, including revising, editing, and rewriting.&nbsp; Her handwriting is very neat and she forms her letters correctly from top to bottom most ;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-04 14:16:06"

<p>Throughout much of Emma&rsquo;s day we notice a sense of urgency and a tendency to rush through her work. She benefits from positive reinforcement in her reading and writing assignments and we use this strategy to help her gain confidence in order to improve her work stamina. &nbsp;At the same time, we are also helping Emma to complete an assignment without the need for praise throughout the process, reminding her it&rsquo;s more efficient and to finish her writing work first and then ask for support with revision and editing.</p>

Isaiah has become an independent, motivated writer who particularly enjoys writing fiction stories. His handwriting and spacing have improved tremendously, and he seems more comfortable 'brave spelling.' Isaiah is working on solidifying blends and digraphs (sh/ch) as well as short vowel sounds.

She applies her phonics skills to sound words as she reads. Her eagerness to get each word correct sometimes distracts from the fluency of her reading. A goal for her is to become more confident reading out loud. Luna has solid comprehension. She can make predictions, inferences, and tell the key points of what she read. Luna is a supportive reading partner. She and her partner are hard at work implementing the different reading strategies and skills taught during the Reading Workshop lessons. We are so proud of how far Luna has come as a reader since the beginning of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luna's writing is a joy to read. She understands the writing process and can brainstorm, organize, and execute each piece of writing. Luna enjoys writing about things she knows. &nbsp;Her personal narratives are detailed and about experiences that are important to her. During our non-fiction unit, Luna showed she can write about subjects she feels she is an expert on. Luna is becoming a more conventional speller especially on high frequency words. Luna takes her time in her writing is loves to share her final product.&nbsp;</p>

Mateo is obviously very bright and we are confident he will be reading up a storm soon! Mateo has shown great growth in his writing even over the past few weeks. He enjoys writing creatively and lets his humor shine through. When you read Mateo's writing you can hear his voice as an author. Mateo is a detailed story teller. He has a plethora of ideas and things he is interested in writing about. Mateo has been putting more and more effort in to his writing and his pictures. He is starting to remember to put spaces in between his words which helps him read back his work. A goal for Mateo is to use more conventional spelling patterns and also to participate more during Writing Workshop.

She uses her Writer&rsquo;s Workshop time effectively, and there are plenty of opportunities for growth in our writing curriculum. Anouska is a very engaged book group member as the smaller groups are more comfortable and it is easier to express her ideas. Here she shares her thoughts and opinions with a bit more confidence. She is a wonderful member to her group and we look forward to hearing her contributions</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-05 10:47:22"

He possesses an impressive writing stamina, but at times loses the focus of the stories as he writes. We think that if he used the prewriting strategy, his stories would be more focused and easier to write. He works to use his writer&rsquo;s tools in his pieces, and writes impressive snapshots and similes. The revision process can be challenging for young writers, but we feel Ciel uses the opportunity to develop as a writer. Ciel is also quite an avid reader, and willingly shares his enthusiasm for literature. He has made progress in coming to his book group meetings prepared and ready to discuss the book. We are glad because we want him to be able to contribute his insightful thoughts and ideas to the group discussion.&nbsp;</p>

Henry sometimes needs teacher reminders to include illustrations with his words, and in coming months will work on revising and editing his stories. In Word Work, Henry is working on solidifying blends and digraphs (sh, st, br) and on beginning long vowel patterns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry sometimes needs reminders to listen while others are talking, and occassionally needs to clarify comments he makes since they seem off topic.&nbsp;</p>

He continues to need support in decoding new words, and is still working on internalizing reading strategies. Holden will sometimes self-correct when something he reads does not make sense, but also often stops and seems 'stuck' on a word he cannot decode. Holden demonstrates excellent comprehension skills and is able to answer both literal and inferential questions in a text. Holden's writing has improved a great deal this year. He is more aware of spacing and letter production, and has a repetoire of many sight words. Holden is working on story structure and craft in his writing. In Word Work, he is gaining more practice with blends and digraphs (sl, st, br, sh/ch) as well as some long vowel patterns.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-05 13:18:25"

She is funny and creative and uses her writer&rsquo;s tools to flesh out her ideas. We would like Gia to work on prewriting and organizing her ideas before she starts writing as this will ensure a more cohesive piece. She is able to work through the revision process, and does not get overly discouraged if her story needs more work. Once Gia has found a &ldquo;just right&rdquo; book, her reading stamina is impressive. Often the content of the book she is interested in does not match her reading level, making it difficult for her to understand what is happening in the story. With more practice reading books that make sense to her, she will continue to grow and improve. Gia is an active, thoughtful member of her book group. She comes to each meeting prepared and ready to participate. At times, she is so eager to talk about the book she struggles to allow others to share their ideas as well. We would like to see her continue to work on this as the year progresses.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-05 13:31:12"

When we are brainstorming for a new subject as a class, Jake works hard to contribute a significant idea or opinion. He seems to enjoy our study of California history, and can quickly recall facts and details for his work. During the animal research project, Jake learned how to take notes from nonfiction text and translate those notes into cohesive paragraphs. At times he struggled in creating organized paragraphs from his notes, yet with teacher support he wrote an interesting report on the mosquito.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-05 13:39:52"

One of his goals this year will be to continue to utilize a prewriting strategy, outlining the major points of his story, before he begins writing. This strategy will ensure that he writes a focused, cohesive story. We would also like to see Luke find more places to add descriptive details into his stories. Writer&rsquo;s Workshop will provide ample opportunities for growth as long as he continues to put forth his personal best on his revisions. Luke enjoys reading, and is an enthusiastic member of book group. He clearly puts forth the effort on his book group sheet to be prepared for the discussion. When he has taken his time, and understands what he has read, it shows during his meeting.

She loves to tell stories, and works diligently during Writer&rsquo;s Workshop to put her ideas down on paper. She appropriately uses learned tools like snapshots and &ldquo;yummy&rdquo; words to add details and descriptive language to her pieces. We are working with all fourth graders on utilizing the strategy of prewriting to ensure their stories are organized. During the revision component of Writer&rsquo;s Workshop, Liv readily uses constructive feedback to add more to her stories. Her personal best is reflected in her final drafts. Spelling is a stretch for Liv and she struggles to recognize learned spelling strategies. She uses the dictionary to find the correct spelling, and we anticipate that with continued exposure to high frequency words, her spelling will improve over time. Liv loves to read, and is an active member of her book group. When she puts forth a significant amount of effort on her book group prep sheet, it allows her to be a thoughtful contributor to her group. We enjoy hearing her ideas during our book group conversations.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-05 13:57:28"

The animal research project provided an opportunity for Liv to learn how to take notes from nonfiction text, and to re-write those notes into organized paragraphs. This report was a stretch for her, as she had to learn how to take quick dash fact notes, and then translate those notes into her own paragraphs.

He is a dynamic and charismatic student who is capable of thoughtful and thorough work. He comes to class each day with great energy, enthusiasm, and a delightful openness to learning. An active participant, he often shares sophisticated and insightful ideas, and as a very skillful listener, he often catches small details and nuances that others miss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Henry is a naturally talented writer with a strong writer&rsquo;s voice! His writing is organized and creative, and he proficiently utilizes writing tools, such as figurative language, sensory details, and thoughts and dialogue, to capture the reader&rsquo;s attention. He incorporates a good understanding of writing mechanics and conventions to his work and is quite efficient with proofreading and editing. Henry should continue to use revision to challenge himself to rearrange text, consolidate and streamline when needed, and further elaborate when effective to take his work to the next level. He worked very hard on his imaginary setting piece, producing a long and, more importantly, solidly crafted story that showcased his writing strengths.

As a reader, Jacob is voracious. Jacob is one of those students that actually has to be told NOT to read. He consumes books with gusto and becomes totally engrossed in his books, so much so that he tries to read (under his desk) through lessons and discussions. While we really dislike having to tell a student to stop reading, Jacob sometimes misses directions and pertinent information because he is not being attentive to what is going on. When reading is the topic at hand, Jacob soars! He enjoys discussing his reading with others, and makes meaningful connections, predictions and inferences with skill. Jacob clearly gets great pleasure from his reading and his comprehension reflects the way he immerses himself in a book. A small stretch for Jacob is his tendency rush at times, especially if he just &ldquo;wants to be done.&rdquo; This might be true for required reading and the rushing often is so that he can get back to his &ldquo;personal choice&rdquo; book. Still, he comprehends books very well, and his verbal responses to what he has read demonstrate his understanding.

<p>Agnes resists joining the class for group times, she often goes to the library to read. &nbsp;She needs an individual invitation from a teacher to get to group</p>
<p>We look forward to continuing our work together to best support Agnes in her learning.</p>

Masha reflects on her own knowledge by comparing and contrasting her answers with answers that get shared by her classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different number sets. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension. Masha enters math group ready to learn. &nbsp;Masha is a joy to have in math group and she is a good role model to fellow math group members. &nbsp;We would like to see Masha slow down a more and remember to go back over her work to check for errors before turning in her work, as when she does make mistakes, they tend to be careless ones. &nbsp;Masha shares out often and can explain her math thinking clearly.</p>

Masha reflects on her own knowledge by comparing and contrasting her answers with answers that get shared by her classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different number sets. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension. Masha enters math group ready to learn. &nbsp;Masha is a joy to have in math group and she is a good role model to fellow math group members. &nbsp;We would like to see Masha slow down a more and remember to go back over her work to check for errors before turning in her work, as when she does make mistakes, they tend to be careless ones. &nbsp;Masha shares out often and can explain her math thinking clearly.</p>

She applies writing tools ably, using figurative language, dialogue, and thoughts used to great effect. She has a good sense of audience and includes her unique writer&rsquo;s voice in her pieces. Grace also takes revision to heart and should use this strength to challenge herself to practice such skills as rearranging text, consolidating, and further elaborating to take her work to the next level. Grace continues to work on her editing skills and should focus on checking her work carefully for error in grammar and writing mechanics, some which are just careless mistakes.</p>

At other times, Molly will become quite animated and share something with enthusiasm, usually one-on-one. In her fist book group cycle, she did not share much during the book group discussions and appeared to defer to her teammates rather than assert herself. Still, the trio ended up presenting a clever project that actually stuck closely to the purpose of the assignment &ndash; to feature the characters in the book. In Molly&rsquo;s reflection about the project, she expressed dissatisfaction about how the process unfolded and did not feel it was a successful project, yet it was well received by her peers.

Olivia is bright and extremely capable, and we would like to see her challenge herself to slow down in the process and devote more time to polishing the work she submits. When she is not focused, Olivia can miss directions and lose track of assignments. She also has a tendency to let socializing and side conversations interrupt class time.&nbsp; When this happens, she often needs repeated reminders from her teachers to get back on task.</p>

<p>Olivia&rsquo;s writing contains flashes of her creativity, but she often stops short of the really detailed pieces of which she is capable. We would like to see her challenge herself to build her writing stamina and craft pieces that reflect her verbal ability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chloe is a stellar language arts student.&nbsp; As a reader, she consumes books at an almost dizzying rate and seems to get so much enjoyment from them!&nbsp; Avid and speedy as she may be, she also comprehends very well and solidly recognizes story features that she will use as evidence to support her analysis of the text.&nbsp; Chloe has come a long way in trusting herself and taking risks.&nbsp; Though she can still appear to abstain from sharing due to what seems to be a combination of lack of confidence and the reluctance of possibly verbalizing something that is incorrect, Chloe is moving past her discomfort and learning to rely on herself more.&nbsp; Chloe still asks the question, <em>Is this enough work? </em>When it comes to reading responses.&nbsp; We continue to ask her to self assess.&nbsp; Her reading reflections are full of great connections, predictions, and inferences.&nbsp; If Chloe should miss a detail in her readin;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-06 17:39:31"

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coco brings her good focus into reading where she reads carefully and wisely stops to questions things she does not understand. In her book group work, she writes sticky notes that are thoughtful and uses textual evidence to support her thinking. Coco uses her Life Skills to collaborate successfully, but we do tend to see her defer to those with louder, stronger voices and appear to experience some frustration when others forge ahead without listening to her.&nbsp; Coco&rsquo;s part in this is that her more quiet and reserved demeanor often results in her unintentionally getting overlooked.&nbsp; We recommend that she make an effort to &ldquo;rehearse&rdquo; possibly places where she can join in comfortably and make sure her valuable voice gets heard.&nbsp; Coco will willingly take on her share of the workload and contributes her best effort.&nbsp; In her collaboration with her <span style='text-decoration: ;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-06 17:44:11"

For the most part Millie Rose produces assignments that do reflect these abilities. But there are also times when she does rush through assignments or give less effort and energy to assignments that require her time and attention to details, spelling, or careful mathematical computations. When redirected by a teacher, she will re-do or correct her work, but we would like to see her be more responsible about self-editing and correcting and even better, putting a little more effort into her initial efforts to avoid having to fix what are very often just careless errors or sloppy work.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-06 19:45:19"

She can easily direct model to solve addition and subtraction problems. Esme is much more focused and productive when she has one on one support. Without that support she is hesitant to set up problems on her own. Esme can count by different intervals to 100. She sometimes skips numbers but is becoming more consistent with this task. Esme can explain her math thinking to her teachers and her peers. &nbsp;She likes playing the math games but will sometime become distracted when it is a game with a partner. We can tell math is a source of strength for Esme. Future goals include remembering to always count on from the higher number, making tens, and doubling numbers. We are proud of her work in math.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-06 20:10:51"

Caring and compassionate, she is such a positive presence in the classroom. &nbsp;MIng-Yen does not often share in group discussions, but when she does, she is always thoughtful and on target with her questions and/or responses. Therefore we would like to see her take some risks by sharing some more of her great ideas and creative thinking.&nbsp;Ming-Yen definitely benefits from one-on-one time from her teachers, although she is capable of being very independent if she has to wait.&nbsp; This perseverance is a real plus as it helps her to sometimes realize that she knows much more than she thought she did. She is well liked by her peers and teachers. Out on the yard, she shows a sense of fairness and treats her classmates in a kind and thoughtful way.

When a word problem is not addition he will sometimes get confused and default to addition. A goal for Evan is to make his math fact more automatic as well as work on his subtraction skills. Evan enjoys math games. He is a good sport and is eager to follow the directions. When Evan becomes frustrated in math he will report things are too hard for him.

However, Evan does notice when he makes a mistake and is able to self correct. &nbsp;Evan's written language is in need of scaffolding and support. &nbsp;He needs to use more of his writing tools such as, story webs, word lists and his personal dictionary, to structure his story. &nbsp;Evan prefers to write with a partner who is able to get the words down on paper. Although he has wonderful ideas to suggest, he still needs the writing practice, but for the sake of Evan having a finished product, we are open to Evan dictating his ideas to a teacher. We have some concerns about Evan's language processing. He needs to hear directions repeated multiple times, and words repeated during dictation. We are supporting Evan by reminding him to listen, and helping him to focus on the steps or directions given.&nbsp;</p>

He has a tendency to divert the conversation to other subjects, so, we bring him back to the topic being discussed. Will has so much to offer to everyone. He has a wealth of knowledge, and a very sophisticated sense of humor. He makes connections to the greater world, and keeps his teachers on their toes. &nbsp;We are very pleased with his growth this semester, and look forward to an amazing second semester!</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-07 06:30:44"

Annabel is a good reading partner who listens when her partner is reading and also helps others sound out words. She comprehends what she reads and can retell the main idea and small details.

<p>Annabel has made great strides in her writing. She began the year very eager to spell things 'right'. This would often result in her getting stuck or needing a teacher's constant support. Now Annabel can get right to work and feels so much more comfortable using her Brave Spelling.

Ming Yen reflects on her own knowledge by comparing and contrasting her answers with answers that get shared by her classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different number sets. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension.

<p>Milla approaches Writing Workshop with a willingness to try new skills. While at times it is a challenge for Milla, she generates topics that have meaning to her and is ready to stretch her stories across multiple pages. Milla can get discouraged easily when ideas do not come readily to her. We are working with Milla to not get frustrated and to truly think about the vast knowledge of ideas she possess. When Milla focuses on a particular subject, she uses wonderful descriptions in her writing and puts forth great effort in her illustrations. With determination and effort Milla produces stories that not only we are proud of, but she is as well.</p>

<div>Mia has made great progress in Writing Workshop, especially in choosing meaningful topics to write about. She enjoys personal narratives and most recently 'how-to' stories and sequences her stories clearly. Mia is doing a great job with correct usage of upper and lower case letters and punctuation, and adores sharing her work with the class. One area we would like to see Mia work on is her attention to overall detial in her illustrations. At times, she seems dissinterested or tired when illustrating her pictures.

Emily is very competent with using her writing tools to enhance her work, elaborating with figurative language and using dialogue and thoughts to great effect.

Additionally, Emily needs to continue to edit and proofread her work carefully to correct errors in grammar and mechanics, many of which are simply careless ones. Emily should also take care to distinguish academic writing from more informal styles.

We feel that he is so capable and bright, but much of what he can do as a reader and writer is untapped. Felix seems to like the feeling of being done with his work and will quickly plow through an assignment. At times, he appears to lack stamina in writing and seems to just want it &ldquo;off my desk, on yours,&rdquo; rather than spending extra time to really produce something that reflects his potential. Sometimes the effort to stay focused and complete the work seems to get in his way. We have found that he stays with his writing a little more when he is typing, and we encourage him to practice it to increase his productivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Felix uses some interesting word choices and his writing is often filled with humor and reflects his unique writer&rsquo;s voice. He is capable of taking an idea and going with it, using his creativity and imagination to fill in the details, but does not always often do so independently. He needs to work on taking a topic and developing it by organizing and sequencing his ideas. The presentation of his work is often quite messy - done in what appears to be a &ldquo;rush&rdquo; without a lot of effort.</p>

She sometimes gets confused when the word problem is a subtraction problem and will default to adding the numbers together. Corinna is working hard on writing her number sentences. Since she can explain her thinking verbally she is ready for this step. Corinna can count to 100 by different increments. She listens to directions and gets right to work.

At times, Maxwell seems to &ldquo;rush to be done&rdquo; and bypasses the chance to use revision to elaborate and enhance his work.&nbsp; We encourage him to embrace revision to bring more clarity and focus to his already solid foundation.&nbsp; He has the ability to &ldquo;shade&rdquo; and &ldquo;tint&rdquo; and to add highlights and shadows, and we would like to see him independently find ways to challenge himself.

He does not tend to do this without some prompting from a teacher, although with the recent practice with the tri-folds he appears to be adding to this skill.

She rises to new challenges put before her with a positive attitude. As a writer, Zoe has an understanding of many of the basic writing conventions, but does sometimes have difficulties with independently applying them to her writing. She is able to craft descriptions using writing tools to add details, but she often sticks to fairly simple, straightforward sentences. We have seen flashes of imagination and creativity in her work and would like her to make use of revision to elaborate, check for coherence, and add sensory details. She should also edit carefully to correct errors in writing mechanics, especially spelling. Zoe would benefit from consistent review of spelling patterns and grammar rules to support her proofreading, as it appears she is not completely clear on some of them.</p>

<p>Zoe has grown as a reader and continues to work on comprehension. She has learned to be more conscientious about making sticky notes to interact with the text.

He takes immense pride in his successes, but struggles to ask for help when he is clearly challenged by a new strategy or concept. He is very hardworking during math group; he chooses a wise seat and uses his time effectively. When he becomes frustrated, he is quick to break down and, at times, becomes tearful. We would like to see him ask for help before he reaches this point of frustration. The strategies he possesses are effective and he is able to use them independently. He also knows his number combinations which aids in his understanding of new information.

She reports loving to listen to stories. When she finds a book she enjoys she likes to read in multiple times. When she is listening to a story, her insight and comprehension is solid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sophia has an artistic strength that allows her to tell her stories through pictures. Sophia is now adding words and labels to her writing. She produces more work when she has one on one support. She is not yet confident trying to write sentences on her own. If we ask her what she wants to say, get her started with the first word, and then walk away she can write much more confidently.

He is especially drawn to non-fiction books, and loves to share his wealth of knowledge. We continue to encourage Will to read more fiction, so that he can connect with the text, himself and others. This would also foster dialogue with friends about books. It could give him more common ground to discuss with his peers. Will's writing ideas are sophiticated and complex. His spelling and sentence structure are usually accurate. Will's handwriting is often hard to read. The letters range in size, and the spacing of the words tend to be nonexistent. When we conference with Will, he clearly sees what we are referring to and is able to make the necessary connections. We continue to encourage Will to organize his folders, his tote, and to remember to put his things away before he moves on to another task.</p>

When redirected by a teacher, he will re-do or correct his work, but we would like to see Rey be more responsible about self-editing and correcting and even better, putting forth a little more effort into his initial efforts to avoid having to fix what are very often just careless errors or sloppy work. Socially, Rey is still working on navigating friendships and certain social situations. He is trying to make better decisions when it comes to problem solving with peers. He does not resort to tears or whining, as often as his first option in problems solving, but instead tries to get teacher help when his feelings get too big and overwhelming for him. We are very proud of this progress with Rey. While at times he still needs support from his teachers to help him with difficult friendship issues, we have definitely seen improvement in this area.

He knows more than the expected sight words and, as a result of his extensive repetoire of reading strategies, he can decode words he has never seen before. Jacob is a supportive reading partner who helps others with unfamiliar words and he contributes to discussions during shared reading time and in book groups. Jacob is not as comfortable reading out loud. Due to this, he does not use the expression we are confident he can when reading out loud and he reads at a slower pace. We strive to help Jacob realize his strength in reading and read more fluently in front of his peers and teachers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing is a strength for Jacob. He always strives to do his best on each writing project. He takes the skills we teach and uses them in his daily writing. His writing can be both creative and informative. Jacob is using complex sentences and proper punctuation. He enjoys when his work is shared out loud. Jacob's 'All About Presidents' book wowed us.

She shows a natural affinity for language arts. Kate arrived in kindergarten with stong phonemic awareness and ability. She now knows all her letter sounds and is working on more complex reading skills. Kate can make predictions, connections, and inferences as she reads, and she confidently sounds out unknown words. Kate and her reading partner are consistently on task. They help each other through their 'Just Right' books and then eagerly discuss what they have read. We are so proud of Kate's development as a reader!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kate can write for a variety of purposes. She likes to write about topics she knows such as her family and friends. Kate follows along in our Writing Workshop lesson and then executes the skill we are practicing independently. Kate feels comfortable writing for pages and pages which is amazing to see! She is a Brave Speller but also knows the conventional spelling of commonly used words. Kate's recent non-fiction work about 'How To Make a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich' allowed her to become the teacher of a subject she considered herself an expert in. We are thrilled with the author Kate has become.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-07 21:07:19"

In reading he can read CVC (consonant vowel consonant) as well as sight words. When we teach a specific rule in reading Matthew is very quick to catch on. For example, when we taught the 'ai' together usually says the long 'a' sound, Matthew successfully read many more words that followed this pattern than before he knew this rule. Matthew needs support to successfully read grade level texts. We are confident the outside help he is receiving will greatly help with his skill and confidence. When Matthew is read to he has impressive comprehension. He connects readings to his own life and is happy to share his understanding with his peers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing is a stretch for Matthew. While his thoughts are detailed and organized, his hand does not seem to keep up with what he wants to say. We are so glad he is receiving help in this area. We have already seen growth in Matthew's writing. He understands every Writing Workshop lesson we teach. The concepts come to him easily. He likes to write about what he knows.

<p>Agnes has improved&nbsp;Last year she came to group time on her own about 10% of the time. &nbsp;This year she comes to group about 30% without intervention from a teacher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has been fun getting to know Eli as a reader, writer, and thinker. He is willing to put forth effort to grasp new concepts and get his work done, and also is inquisitive and open to new ideas. At times, the multi-faceted aspects of the language arts curriculum seem a bit daunting to Eli, but he wisely chooses to ask clarifying questions rather than remain in doubt. At times, however, he misses small details in multi-step directions, both oral and written, and makes errors as a result. It does not always seem that he truly misunderstood the information, and it often appears he was rushing to finish or distracted during the reading or listening of the directions. We will continue to remind Eli to check his work carefully before submitting it.</p>

As a reader, Jacob is voracious. Jacob is one of those students that actually has to be told NOT to read. He consumes books with gusto and becomes totally engrossed in his books, so much so that he tries to read (under his desk) through lessons and discussions. While we really dislike having to tell a student to stop reading, Jacob sometimes misses directions and pertinent information because he is not being attentive to what is going on. When reading is the topic at hand, Jacob soars! He enjoys discussing his reading with others, and makes meaningful connections, predictions and inferences with skill. Jacob clearly gets great pleasure from his reading and his comprehension reflects the way he immerses himself in a book. A small stretch for Jacob is his tendency rush at times, especially if he just &ldquo;wants to be done.&rdquo; This might be true for required reading and the rushing often is so that he can get back to his &ldquo;personal choice&rdquo; book.

He enters the classroom with inquisitiveness, and he immediately gets himself prepared to take in new information. He is extremely capable and always appears to enjoy the feeling of being on top of his work. Myles attributes include being conscientious and responsible and he takes great pride in giving his best effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a writer, Myles is creative and imaginative. He can utilize his writing tools by adding figurative language and descriptive phrases to his work. Myles uses strategies and tools that we teach to great effect. We encourage him to consistently use pre-writing to help him organize his work and give him a guide to follow carefully. Sometimes, the ideas that are very clear in Myles&rsquo; mind do not make it onto the paper. He would benefit from using revision to clarify, tighten his focus, and add transitional sentences to enhance the flow of his writing. At times, he makes quick&nbsp; shifts from one things to another without fully explaining with supporting details.&nbsp; A possible strategy would be for him to read his writing aloud, as it might help him catch inconsistencies and sentences and phrases that don&rsquo;t quite make sense ;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-08 04:54:04"

Olivia thinks on her feet and picks up concepts quickly. She can be organized and efficient when she is focused on her work. At times, Olivia&rsquo;s efficiency appears to cross over into a rush to be done. She likes to complete her work, but does not always put in her best effort. Olivia is bright and extremely capable, and we would like to see her challenge herself to slow down in the process and devote more time to polishing the work she submits. When she is not focused, Olivia can miss directions and lose track of assignments. She also has a tendency to let socializing and side conversations interrupt class time.&nbsp; When this happens, she often needs repeated reminders from her teachers to get back on task.</p>

<p>Olivia&rsquo;s writing contains flashes of her creativity, but she often stops short of the really detailed pieces of which she is capable.

Good-natured and flexible, Toochi comes to class open to learning new things and receptive to new concepts and strategies. He sometimes has some difficulty keeping track of assignments. He has needed our support to be responsible for all his work and reminders about some of the oral directions he has missed. He is working on tactics to keep himself organized and on-task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toochi has definite strengths as a writer. He is not afraid to put his creative and expressive thinking on paper. His writing is a bit inconsistent. At times he is capable of crafting imaginative pieces that include detail and the use of writing tools, and other times his sentences are very simplistic without much elaboration. He sometimes appears to lack stamina in writing and sometimes seems to just &ldquo;want to be done,&rdquo; rather than spend extra time to really improve and enhance his work. Sometimes the effort to stay focused and complete the work seems to get in his way. Toochi has beautiful cursive handwriting, and it takes him some time to write out his thoughts.

In some cases, he does quite well. He is capable of listening intently and participating in discussions enthusiastically. He often throws himself into assignments that he is really interested in and can stay on-task until completion. At other times, he seems to &ldquo;drift&rdquo; and lose focus, missing key points and directions that sometimes result in late or incomplete work.

<p>Talia&rsquo;s writing is progressing nicely, and she always shows enthusiasm for learning new concepts. She often writes creative pieces using writing tools to craft descriptive images. Talia continues to work on her writing organization. &nbsp;We would like to see her spend more time on revision by exmining her writing structure and challenging herself to craft more complex sentences, polish her transitions, and sharpen her focus. She should also consistently and carefully proofread and edit to check for errors in writing mechanics, many of which appear to be careless, and refer to a dictionary to check the spelling of unknown words.</p>

Some of this appears to be related to her confidence, which while it has increased tremendously, still holds her back a little from sharing her thinking unless she is really sure it is &ldquo;correct.&rdquo; We suggest that Amelia continue to read aloud to an adult to improve her fluency and comprehension.

Whereas he used to listen when we read to the class out loud, his hand now shoots up in the air to share his thoughts. His insights about the stories are greatly appreciated! Neo is beginning to take more risks and be more engaged during reading. He 'needs support' in the areas we typically expect to support a kindergartener in! We are pleased with his development as a reader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neo uses his artistic gift during Writing Workshop. Each picture he draws is thought out, intentional, and incredibly detailed. He can tell an entire story using his pictures. Neo is now beginning to add words to his stories. When we sit with him and help him sound out words he can write entire sentences. His penmanship is beautiful. A goal for Neo is to independently start sound words out. He is right on the brink of doing so and we are so excited to see his cont;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-02-08 06:37:34"
