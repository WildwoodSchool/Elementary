His written and verbal communication, projects, and end of unit assessment reflect an excellent understanding and application of this intensive's physics concepts.&nbsp; We look forward to working with Marlo again after the Winter Break.</p>

<p>We have seen some growth in Ariyah's reading. Her fluency has improved, however, she still tends to gloss over words that she doesn't know, and in its place, substitute a word that does not fit the context of the story. When reading with Ariyah, we use a variety of strategies to help her decode the unknown word, and therefore, comprehend what she's reading.</p>
<p>Ariyah's written language also has some of the same confusion as does her expressive language.

She easily makes connections between concepts and makes meaningful contributions to the discussions. When working with others she is exceptionally kind, flexible, and patient at all times. Josie is thoughtful of others and always willing to help. She is also incredibly perceptive, insightful, and sensitive to those around her. The work in her folder is very organized, neatly presented and detailed. Josie did an incredible job on her tidal zone brochure on sea stars. The work is beautifully done and she was very successful in putting the information in her own words and explaining the facts. Josie is an asset to the lab and we truly look forward to working with her the rest of the year.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-09 15:28:11"

He brings joy and fun into his learning and displays inquisitiveness about the world around him. Most of the time Henry is focused and on-task. However, he benefits at times from a reminder to follow the directions or to stay engaged as he gets distracted by side conversations at his table. Henry seems more grounded when there is a plan involving one-on-one support from his teachers especially to do with direction following and making sure he's on task when working in group settings. Sometimes he needs to be reminded to use his Life Skills when working with others. Throughout the semester he has demonstrated a thorough comprehension of all of the concepts. The work in his Science folder is neatly presented, organized, and detailed. He did an especially nice job on his tidal zone brochure on limpets. Henry carefully put the ideas into his own words and explained his thoughts clearly. </p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-09 15:30:48"

Angus works carefully and has learned the value of going over his work to check for errors. Recently, he has taken on the role as peer teacher and several times we have observed him helping out classmates with their math work.&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, he seems to need more support with new material, but once he understands a new concept, he is ready to take it on. &nbsp;He has a conceptual understanding of multiplication and is working on learning &nbsp;his multiplication facts to automaticity. Angus was able to practice the concept of money through an in class project called 'Enchanted Enchilada'. &nbsp;He showed a good understaning for making change and using various bills. &nbsp;We look forward to seeing his math confidence and knowledge grow throughout the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Annabelle comes to school daily with a positive attitude, ready to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- She is thoughtful and expressive in her communication during class discussions and chooses her vocabulary carefully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Annabelle takes direction well and learns from her mistakes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Socially: On an individual basis, Annabelle works well with all children. We are helping Annabelle to decipher when she does and does not need to involve herself in other people's differences.

<p>Canaan thrives when he is asked to think outside of the box. If he is given an open-ended assignment like a Venn Diagram, where is asked to compare and contrast something, his ideas are endless. He makes connections between himself and his culture and other people/characters and theirs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canaan takes great care with his Social Studies work. He asks thoughtful questions that provoke deeper discussion. He thinks before he writes, and he has a vision before he begins.

<p>- Emma takes pride in her reading and writing work. She had begun to understand the importance of a 'just right' book choice, and how it will help her improve her skills.</p>
<p>-She benefits from positive reinforcement in her reading and writing assignments and we use this strategy to help her gain confidence in order to improve her work stamina. At the same time, we are also helping Emma to complete an assignment without the need for praise throughout the process. It's okay to finish and then ask for edits. Perfection seems to be something Emma strives for, and that isn't always beneficial to her.</p>

<p>- Donny brings a unique and worldly perspective to our class social studies conversations. He is always enthusiastic to share his own culture and family traditions and does so with thoughtful and expressive language. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- When discussing systems, Donny thinks deeply and creatively. He likes to bring advanced topics to the circle such as global warming and evolution, and ties these topics into our systems discussions about water, community, and food.

<p>- Emma is enthusiastic to learn. She always comes to school on time and puts forth excellent effort. Emma is working on gaining confidence in her work so that she does not need constant teacher approval to move on to the next task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Socially- Emma has set many goals for herself over the past few months in order to keep peace within her interactions with others. She has done an excellent job attempting to keep away from unhealthy relationships with peers. She has successfully explored other friendships and has used her 'i messages' to communicate when conflicts arise. With that said, this is still a work in progress. We are helping Emma navigate through these situations. We are also helping Emma understand the concept of 'leaving it at the door' (an idea that helps second graders shift their focus away from social unrest when it is learning time).</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-13 08:16:40"

<p>- Emma takes pride in her reading and writing work. She had begun to understand the importance of a 'just right' book choice, and how it will help her improve her skills.</p>
<p>-She benefits from positive reinforcement in her reading and writing assignments and we use this strategy to help her gain confidence in order to improve her work stamina. At the same time, we are also helping Emma to complete an assignment without the need for praise throughout the process. It's okay to finish and then ask for edits. Perfection seems to be something Emma strives for, and that isn't always beneficial to her.</p>

However, when we are able to have a more intimate conversation with Jennifer, it becomes evident that she is, in fact, grasping concepts.

In addition, we went into depth about the myths and stereotypes of Native Americans, past and present, and recognized their contributions to American culture. It is difficult in certain ways to assess Alexandra's understanding of our social studies curriculum, because she does not readily participate in class discussions, and often times, her expressive thought processes are not organized or sequential. However, when we are able to have a more intimate conversation with Alexandra, it becomes evident that she is, in fact, grasping concepts. We will continue to encourage Alexandra to express her thinking, even if she is reticent to do so. We will support her in attending to the topic being discussed and to take the necessary risk to participate.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-14 16:36:11"

<p>- Socially- Fischer is well-liked and keeps busy on the yard. Rarely does he need adult help to solve his problems.

Evan has found his place with his peers on Big Yard, and can be found running and playing with exuberance. In the classroom, Evan is open and enthusiastic about learning and loves to contribute to class discussions. We are supporting Evan in improving his listening skills in the classroom, as he often needs directions repeated several times before he begins a task. This listening issue spans across all subjects, and sometimes causes Evan to fall behind, so we are helping him learn the importance of the skill and sharing positive reinforcement as needed.

Students reflect on their own knowledge by comparing and contrasting their answers with answers that get shared by their classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different numbers. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension. The year began with a multiplication unit with an addition unit embedded within. Kris has a conceptual understanding of mutliplication and is working on memorizing his multiplication math facts.

Students reflect on their own knowledge by comparing and contrasting their answers with answers that get shared by their classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different numbers. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension. The year began with a multiplication unit with an addition unit embedded within. Kris has a conceptual understanding of mutliplication and is working on memorizing his multiplication math facts.

We are helping the class understand how important it is to be unique, original, and independent in one's work, and we remind the girls of this often. Jenny has become more focused and participatory in class discussions, and we enjoy listening to her idea. She is extremely helpful to her classmates and teachers, and values her role as a cooperative group member. We have enjoyed getting to know Jenny this semester and look forward to seeing her growth continue.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-16 14:29:52"

Jenny works very hard and is dedicated to becoming a better reader. We would recommend that she continue to receive support during the summer in order to keep moving her towards her goal. Jenny struggles to write a clear and organized story. Her spelling and sentence structure are currently below grade level. We are working with Jenny to organize her thinking by using a story web, a word list, her personal dictionary, and other strategies that will help her to complete a writing task with success.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-16 14:31:08"

We are supporting Evan in improving his listening skills in the classroom, as he often needs directions repeated several times before he begins a task. We often need to&nbsp;redirect Evan during circle time because he continues to have private conversations.&nbsp;This listening issue spans across all subjects, and sometimes causes Evan to fall behind.

<p>Ben's writing is a concern at this time. He is reluctanct to produce written work independently. He has a strong ability to storytell. However, when given the opportunity to work independently he becomes easily frustrated and is unable to produce meaningful pieces of writing.

Activities have included counting, recognizing, naming, and ordering numbers up to 30 consistently. The children use tangible objects to determine the answers to addition and subtraction problems. Bianca is beginning to understand addition strategies and is learning to solve story problems. She is working on counting fluency and number identification. At times Bianca can be hesitant about her work and math thinking, but with more exposure and practice her confidence will continue to grow.<br /><br /></p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-16 19:44:53"

<p>- In social studies group projects or assignments (such as collecting data about water sources around Wildwood and exploring how water systems help our community) Emma comfortably fits into the leadership role and can easily expresses herself in group settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Emma respectfully listens in class to read aloud and group discussions about other cultures and communities and later makes connections about other cultures and her own. She expresses these ideas through her journaling and classwork.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-17 06:44:02"

<p>- Emma takes pride in her reading and writing work. She had begun to understand the importance of a 'just right' book choice, and how it will help her improve her skills.</p>
<p>-She benefits from positive reinforcement in her reading and writing assignments and we use this strategy to help her gain confidence in order to improve her work stamina. At the same time, we are also helping Emma to complete an assignment without the need for praise throughout the process. It's okay to finish and then ask for edits. Perfection seems to be something Emma strives for, and that isn't always beneficial to her.</p>

<p>- Emma is enthusiastic to learn. She always comes to school on time and puts forth excellent effort. Emma is working on gaining confidence in her work so that she does not need constant teacher approval to move on to the next task.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Socially- Emma has set many goals for herself over the past few months in order to keep peace within her interactions with others. She has done an excellent job attempting to keep away from unhealthy relationships with peers. She has successfully explored other friendships and has used her 'i messages' to communicate when conflicts arise. With that said, this is still a work in progress. We are helping Emma navigate through these situations. We are also helping Emma understand the concept of 'leaving it at the door' (an idea that helps second graders shift their focus away from social unrest when it is learning time).</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-17 06:44:21"

<p>- Most of the time, Ethan is well-behaved, focused, and hard-working</p>
<p>- He is an academic joy to have in class. He participates thoughtfully, and does his work with ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Ethan is still working on resisting silliness when prompted by his peers. He responds well when he is reminded of consequences by his teachers, and he is working on relying on himself to avoid these situations.</p>
<p>Socially- Ethan does well during Big Yard. He has playmates, and can be found running and playing with a smile on his face. <em>(Sarah- I am going to spend some time on Monday watching him on BY, as I remember his parents were relieved to know he wasn't exhibiting 'loner' behavior.

<p>- When participating during Social Studies, Ethan takes his time and thinks before he speaks. He uses his wide vocabulary to express his ideas, and always seems to come from a place of compassion and gentleness when discussing others (like the characters we read about).&nbsp;</p>
<p>- When learning about other people and cultures, Ethan looks at the 'big picture' and can efficiently articulate his thoughts to his classmates by shedding light on an angle they might not have thought of. This aides in his understanding of how the world works, and helps him view situations through others' perspectives too.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-17 06:44:49"

<p>- Fischer is working on his self motivation. Often needs teacher prompting to begin assignments, especially writing related.</p>

<p>- Fischer is loving, kind and sensitive. He understands what it means to be a member of a group and his role in the classroom is important to him.</p>
<p>- He uses the word 'can't' far too often, mostly when he hasn't attempted the task at hand. He is discouraged during open ended assignments due to lack of inspiration. This seems to be a bi-product of a deep academic confidence issue.</p>
<p>- Using his Dad's technique (Here are three words...now tell a story using those three words in the story) WORKS! Not only does Fischer appreciate that we obviously communicate with his parents, but he can work in this creative way because he's had practice with it at home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Socially- Fischer is well-liked and keeps busy on the yard. Rarely does he need adult help to solve his problems. He is easily able to resolve conflict with his peers and&nbsp;&nbsp;apologize when he is at fault.

Earnest and hard-working, Kris puts effort into his work. He benefits from one-on-one time with his teachers in order to solidify concepts that we have taught. He sometimes needs clarification of lessons and needs things broken into steps.&nbsp; Usually, repetition serves him well and once he masters the steps, he can work independently. However, it seems that his mental energy cannot always keep up with the pace of the work.&nbsp; To his credit, he does not allow himself to become upset or flustered, but we are concerned that any significant increase in the tempo of the work will cause him to fall behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>;reader_notes=;notes=Parents have been informed by classroom teachers and Shahrazad about the need for outside support (ed. therapy) for Kris (Alex). Meeting held on 12/14 and parents agreed with the necessity to get support for Kris.  Concerns are based on assessments of reading, writing, and math skills. Kris is reading below grade level (2.2) and has difficulty with comprehension (both literal and inferential). Currently he is in the 'lowest' math group and with support feels successful. 
To his credit we have seen improvement from the beginning of the year in writing.  He is writing more content and his spelling has improved.;status=3;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-17 15:26:39"
