Evan has found his place with his peers on Big Yard, and can be found running and playing with exuberance. In the classroom, Evan is open and enthusiastic about learning and loves to contribute to class discussions. We are supporting Evan in improving his listening skills in the classroom, as he often needs directions repeated several times before he begins a task. We often need to&nbsp;redirect Evan during circle time because he continues to have private conversations.&nbsp;This listening issue spans across all subjects, and sometimes causes Evan to fall behind. &nbsp;It is important for Evan to understand that his teachers are in charge of the class ,and that he doesn't have to monitor everyone's behavior or equity issues. We are helping him learn the importance of listening, and sharing positive reinforcement as needed.

<p>- Kyle is inconsistent in the effort he puts forward. Some days, he is inspired and proud of his work, and other days, he uses the word 'can't', says 'I don't know' when we ask questions, and rushes through his work, often missing the point of an assignment. (for example, the show not tell writing assignment- first draft day)</p>
<p>- His handwriting needs improvement, as does his written organizational skills</p>
<p>-During quiet reading time, Kyle often uses a full voice as he reads aloud to himself. We are helping him understand that this may be distracting to others, and that, although it's okay to do his silent reading with a low hum or whisper, he will have to lower his voice in a group setting.</p>
<p>- Kyle has been doing a terrific job with his reading homework, and this is leading to improvements in his skills.</p>
<p>- During word work, Kyle is engaged and enthusiastic. He comes ready to do his best learning.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-18 05:51:41"

<p>- Kyle loves to be a member of a community and loves to have fun with his classmates.</p>
<p>- This semester, we've been helping Kyle with his spacial awareness during circle time. He often inches from his spot toward the middle of the circle and needs to be reminded several times to find his place so that he doesn't block others. I'm happy to report that we've seen some great improvements recently in this area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Kyle really responds well to praise and positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Socially- Kyle is working to use i-messages to solve problems with his peers. If he feels that someone is not treating him with kindness, we encourage him to express this through the conflict resolution tools we've taught him. We will continue to keep an eye on Kyle to be sure he is feeling safe and happy at school.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have seen some growth in Ariyah's reading. Her fluency has improved, however, she still tends to gloss over words that she doesn't know, and in its place, substitute a word that does not fit the context of the story. When reading with Ariyah, we use a variety of strategies to help her decode the unknown word, and therefore, comprehend what she's reading.</p>
<p>Ariyah's written language also has some of the same confusion as does her expressive language. Through writing conferences, we are helping Ariyah to organize her ideas using story webs and word lists to clarify her thinking.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-18 14:24:24"

He has difficulty differentiating between long and short vowel sounds, which impedes his ability to decode unknown words. &nbsp;When the class is taking a dictation in word work, Evan needs to have everything repeated several times, and he continues to ask for clarification of directions. We're supporting Evan by keeping him focused, and on-task when directions are given. We are helping him to resist engaging in distractions. Evan enjoys doing collaborative writing with friends and prefers to do the illustrations rather than the actual writing. When Evan writes, he has difficulty sequencing ideas into a cohesive story. When we conference with Evan on his writing, we suggest he make word lists or use a story web to organize his thinking. Also, we are open to Evan dictating his stories so that the writing struggle is lessened.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-18 14:32:38"

Earnest and hard-working, Beckett puts effort into his work, although his work pace can be slow. He benefits from one-on-one time with his teachers in order to solidify concepts that we have taught. He sometimes needs clarification of lessons and needs things broken into steps.&nbsp; Usually, repetition serves him well and once he masters the steps, he can work independently. Beckett is always engaged in a variety of sport activities at Big Yard and is able to move between different groups of children with ease. He lives by the Wildwood Life Skills and is well liked by his teachers and peers.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-18 14:51:05"

When she is having fun, her joyfulness is contagious. She is incredibly creative and we see this creativity as an outlet and an anchor for her.&nbsp; She tends to put her own twist on class assignments so she can express herself the way she feels most comfortable.&nbsp; Her best work typically stems from projects with a visual element.</p>
<p>We are helping Clara use strategies to stay on task with her classwork. She has difficulty hearing directions the first one or two times they are given. She often takes additional time to finish her assignments and then struggles to catch up to the group. &nbsp;We feel that this causes Clara to experience a disconnect with the curriculum and we are doing our best to support her in this.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Clara often spends her Big Yard time alone and appears sad.&nbsp; She alludes to the fact that this stems from her lack of friends, but has not wanted to discuss it in full.&nbsp;We will continue to support and encourage her to reach out to new peers.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-19 10:04:45"

He is a wonderfully deep thinker and out-of-the box thinker, raising the level of our class discussions tremendously.&nbsp; There are times when Donny has a hard time accepting others&rsquo; ideas and views when they differ from his own.&nbsp; He also uses clever syntax to creatively debate with his teachers, sometimes with a disrespectful tone and attitude.</p>
<p>Donny needs frequent reminders to get started on his work and to stay focused during work times. He tends to chat with his neighbors and as a result does not always complete the quality of work he is capable of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to start the day relaxed and ready to learn, we highly recommend that Donny arrive to school on time or even a little early. His numerous tardies have had a negative impact on his ability to connect with his classmates and the curriculum. &nbsp;It is visible in his body language that he sometimes has difficulty relaxing into the environment on days that he is not present when the bell rings.</p>

She is enthusiastic about everything we do. Addison is friendly to her peers and will go out of her way to ask people to play with her. She is incredibly inclusive and eager to make others feel good. Addison is working hard on the Life Skill of flexibility. When things do not go as she expects or when she feel she has made a 'mistake' she will often become upset. We have seen great strides in her ability to take a deep breath and realize that everyone makes mistakes. We see Addison's confidence growing on a daily basis. She began the year not sure she could do the monkey bars and now can do them with ease, skipping bars and going backwards. She takes great pride in all her accomplishments both in and outside of the classroom. Addison is an attentive listener. She benefits from reminders to go back and add details to her work as she loves to be the first one finished. We are thrilled with what a wonderful role model Addison.

A goal for Bryce is to more actively participate in class. We know she has great ideas and we want her to be more confident raising her hand to share them. Socially, Bryce is thriving. She came in with a core group of friends who she is still close to. Bryce can work well with anyone in the class. We have seen a great growth in her ability to work independently without asking for teacher help immediately. She now listens to the directions, gets to work on her own, and asks for help only when she needs clarification.

In all his writing pieces, Sam makes good use of his substantial writing tools, though he sometimes struggles with writing his memoirs. Sam could benefit from spending time planning his ideas, and thinking about the message he hopes to communicate in his writing. Doing so will allow Sam to elaborate upon, and add depth, to his creative writing.</p>
<p>Sam always comes to book group well-prepared, having gone above and beyond the homework's requirements, ready to share his ideas about the text. In <em>The School Story, Heartbeat, and The Cay, </em>Sam asked questions, made great connections, backed up his predictions, shared important details, and readily participated in all of our conversations, providing his group with wonderful topics for discussion. He is a valuable asset to book group.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-21 15:45:00"

His fluency and comprehension are incredible for a Kindergartner. Brendan can decode above grade lever words with ease. He reads for a variety of reasons but especially loves non fiction books. When reading or listening to someone else reading Brendan makes predictions, inferences, and picks up on nuances in the book. Brendan recognizes reading is a strength of his but is always willing to help others out in a kind a patient way. We are amazed by what an avid reader Brendan is and we know this skill will help him throughout his life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Writing is another of Brendan's strengths. Since the beginning of the year Brendan has learned to make spaces without marks, use his Brave Spelling, and write complete sentences. We have observed a huge amount of growth in both the quantity and quality of Brendan's writing during Writing Workshop. He is very attentive during the mini lesson and executes the skill we are focusing on that day. Brendan takes great pride in his writing and does not rush to finish. Each page he writes is detailed, beautiful illustrated, and well thought out. We are very proud of Brendan's work as a writer and will continue to help him solidify this craft.&nbsp;</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-21 20:31:40"

We continue to encourage Bronte to take risks and feel confident in herself as a mathematician. She is a joy to teach.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-21 21:26:04"

He is eager to make connections and enjoys working and playing in small groups. &nbsp;Eli is perfectly at home in his second grade classroom. His level of comfort allows him to take risks and ask questions. &nbsp;He is also prone to slipping into &nbsp;'class clown' behaviors, engaging in whispered side conversations and interrupting whole group discussions with comments he thinks will get a laugh. Eli is responsive to teachers connecting with him privately after moments like these to process with him in order to help him understand his impact on the group. &nbsp;Recently, Eli responded with enthusiasm and seriousness to a conversation we had with the whole group, where we were problem solving to find alternate ways to dispel energy in positive ways when it comes bubbling up at inapporpriate times. &nbsp;He demonstrated a meditation he had learned from his mother and proudly taught it to everyone. We greatly enjoy Eli's sense of humor when used at appropriate times and appreciate his often thougthful and connected comments during whole group meetings.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-21 22:10:50"

She needs to remember that not all of her friends are as able to focus on both work and play simultaneously. &nbsp;She benefits from teacher reminders at times to choose independent work spaces, or work without talking to friends to make sure her peers can enjoy the same success she usually experiences with the outcome of any given assignment. &nbsp;Ever is a capable, mature, warm and caring friend and student.&nbsp; Her steady, calm and kind presence is a gift to our group.</p>

Evan has found his place with his peers on Big Yard, and can be found running and playing with exuberance. In the classroom, Evan is open and enthusiastic about learning and loves to contribute to class discussions. We are supporting Evan in improving his listening skills in the classroom, as he often needs directions repeated several times before he begins a task. We often need to&nbsp;redirect Evan during circle time because he continues to have private conversations.&nbsp;This listening issue spans across all subjects, and sometimes causes Evan to fall behind. &nbsp;It is important for Evan to understand that his teachers are in charge of the class ,and that he doesn't have to monitor everyone's behavior or equity issues. We are helping him learn the importance of listening, and sharing positive reinforcement as needed. It's been a pleasure getting to know Evan this semester and we look forward to seeing his growth continue.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-22 15:42:02"

Often they will finish reading their book quickly but will guess on a lot of the words rather than using the tools we are working on. When Bryce reads with a teacher she remembers to use these tools.

She can independently chose 'Just Right' books. Not only is Carys able to fluently read the books she picks she also has solid comprehension. Carys makes connections to what she is reading and other things we are talking about in class. Carys feels comfortable reading out loud to her peers and this is a huge source of growth for her! Our Non-Fiction unit empowered Carys to use books to learn about new things on her own. It is our hope Carys will maintain her love of reading for the rest of her life because we know books can take her anywhere she wants.</p>
<p>Carys is a wonderful story teller. She picks a concrete idea, organizes her thoughts, and executes her writing in a detailed manner. We have begun editing Carys work to help her with more conventional spelling. A goal for Carys is to work on irregular spelling patterns especially middle vowel patterns. We know she is ready for this. Carys uses adjectives to make her writing more interesting. Carys uses writing to reflect on real life incidents. We will challenge her in the future to write fictional/fantasy pieces. Her penmanship is beautiful. Reading and writing remain a source of stength for Carys and we are so ;reader_notes=;notes=;status=0;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-22 19:30:27"

He is especially drawn to non-fiction books, and loves to share his absolute wealth of knowledge. We continue to encourage Will to read more fiction, so that he can connect with the text, himself and others. This would also foster dialogue with friends about books. It could give him more common ground to discuss with his peers. Will's writing ideas are sophiticated and complex. His spelling and sentence structure are usually accurate. Will's handwriting is often hard to read. The letters range in size, and the spacing of the words tend to be nonexistent. When we conference with Will, he clearly sees what we are referring to and is able to make the necessary connections. We continue to encourage Will to organize his folders, his tote, and to remember to put his things away before he moves on to another task.</p>

Although he has wonderful ideas to suggest, he still needs the writing practice, but for the sake of Evan having a finished product, we are open to Evan dictating his ideas to a teacher.

Eli reflects on his own knowledge by comparing and contrasting his answers with answers that get shared by his classmates. This 'discovery' of recognizing that there is value to more than one approach to answer a question, and there are many ways to get to a mathematical answer, is a key component in this math instruction. Classroom work is differentiated through 'leveled' number sets. Where all students have access to answer the same word problem, using different number sets. Sharing out, solving problems in more than one way, reviewing skills are essential to mathematical reasoning and comprehension.&nbsp;Eli&nbsp;&nbsp;enters math group ready to learn. &nbsp;He is a joy to have in math group and he is a good role model to fellow math group members. &nbsp;We would like to see Eli slow down a more and remember to go back over his work to check for errors before turning in his work, as when he does make mistakes, they tend to be careless ones. &nbsp;Eli shares out often and can explain his math thinking clearly.</p>

In all his writing pieces, Sam makes good use of his substantial writing tools, though he sometimes struggles with writing his memoirs. Sam could benefit from spending time planning his ideas, and thinking about the message he hopes to communicate in his writing. Doing so will allow Sam to elaborate upon, and add depth, to his creative writing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam always comes to book group well-prepared, having gone above and beyond the homework's requirements, ready to share his ideas about the text.

Bryce uses the pictures to help her understand the story. She is tracking each word and using her phonetic skills to decode grade level words. A goal for Bryce is to read her 'Just Right' books with her reading partner multiple times. Often they will finish reading their book quickly but will guess on a lot of the words rather than using the tools we are working on. When Bryce reads with a teacher she remembers to use these tools. We would like to see Bryce feel more confident to participate during read aloud because we know she has great ideas to share.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryce has shown growth in both the quality and quantity of her written work. Bryce understands craft of story telling including characters, plot, and setting. Recently in our Non-fiction unit Bryce showed her strength in using her illustrations to tell a story. She drew beautifully detailed pictures for her book titled, 'How To Be A Good Friend.' Bryce then went through her book and added words to each page. She is becoming a fantastic Brave Speller! Bryce knows her beginning and ending sounds and is beginning to master her short vowel sounds.

<p>We are working on fluency while reading aloud with Ava. Her comprehension skills are strong and she is able to answer questions about the text. We are excited to see Ava grow as a reader.</p>
<p>One area where we will continue to support Ava is in using an age appropriate voice to express her thoughts and needs.

In the classroom, we observe Hudson being cooperative and flexible in partnerships and in group work. On Big Yard, Hudson can be found playing a fast-paced football or soccer game with his friends.
