Although his assignments reflect understanding and application of the concepts we are teaching, he isn&rsquo;t always able to show the depth of his thinking in this format. He misses the detail that he expresses in his verbal communication and his written responses are often fragmented or incomplete. However, Christian&rsquo;s work is always neatly presented and well organized.&nbsp; He takes careful notes in his journal and is conscientious about fixing mistakes. It is clear that he has a good work ethic. Christian did a great job on his end of unit assessment.&nbsp; He demonstrated a good retention and application for vocabulary and key simple machine and laws of motion concepts that were taught in this unit. We look forward to teaching Christian again after the Winter Break.</p>;submit=Calculate;","2012-12-17 11:54:46"

<p>As a writer, Chloe is imaginative and creative. She needs to continue to work on editing her work for capitalization, punctuation, and correct spelling. &nbsp;We are encouraging her to use her personal dictionary to recognize the conventional spelling of a word when writing. At this point, Chloe needs teacher support to become aware of conventional spelling patterns.

For the most part, Jacob is quick to pick up new concepts and does a nice job making connections and drawing conclusions. Jacob is still working on remembering to raise his hand when he wants to share during discussions rather than shouting out his ideas. We notice that sometimes Jacob will miss verbal and written directions and because of this he has the tendency to skip problems or make careless errors in his work. Jacob did a great job building his electrically powered car. &nbsp;He even spent his free time in the science lab so that he could refine his design and create add-ons to the chassis. &nbsp;His end of unit assessment reflects a sound understanding and retention of the physics curriculum taught during this intensive study and we look forward to working with him again after the break.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2012-12-20 22:17:13"

She is a kind and flexible friend who brings many Life Skills to both group and independent work.&nbsp; She follows spoken and written directions well. We can always trust her to be responsible in labs regardless of her partner. We appreciate the way Amelia strikes a balance between taking her work seriously and still enjoying her friendships. Amelia will participate in classroom discussions but we would like to hear from her a little bit more frequently. The notes and assignemts in Amelia's science journal are neatly written and the content is sound. However, she can sometimes be disorganzied with materials in the lab or forgets to bring her journal back to school. &nbsp;When Amelia is unsure of directions or if an assignment or concept is confusing her she will seek us out for support.&nbsp; She is always willing to work with us one-on-one until she has clear understanding of the concept and our expectations. Her performance on various unit projects and on the end of unit assessment reflects a solid understanding for the main concepts taught in this intensive.&nbsp; We look forward to working with Amelia again after the break.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2012-12-21 11:02:19"

This year, Emily still exhibits some anxiety when unsure of directions, or when she is uncertain of how to proceed with a task. She will then need to check with us in order to proceed, sometimes becoming stuck until she has confirmed that she was, indeed, on the right track. &nbsp;Emily continues to be an active participant in classroom discussions. &nbsp;She frequently raises her hand to answer review questions, share thoughts and connections, or to clarify when confused. She clearly and confidently expresses her science thinking during these times in class. Emily is equally able to convey her thoughts in writing. &nbsp;Her science journal is well-organized and the notes are neatly written. &nbsp;Her written responses are detailed. &nbsp;They reflect a good understanding and application of the physics concepts taught in this unit. &nbsp;Emily is carefuly about going back and fixing mistakes in her work or making annotations that help furthur her understanding of a complicated idea. &nbsp;She has a strong work ethic. &nbsp;Emily cares about producing work that is her P;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-01 21:53:30"

<p>Amelia has made a lot of progress over the years with her ability to work cooperatively on projects with other members of the class. &nbsp;She asks for help when conflicts arise and is better able to receive feedback and move on.</p>
<p>We are so proud of Amelia's grasp of the physics concepts taught during this unit of study. &nbsp;The ending assessment reflected her excellent understanding of the laws of motion and simple machines concepts that we taught. &nbsp;She was able to remember complicated vocabulary, apply her knowledge in number and word problems, accurately label diagrams, and recall factual information. &nbsp;We are proud of her work and we look forward to teaching Amelia again after the Winter Break.</p>;reader_notes=;notes=;status=1;submit=Save Section;","2013-01-01 22:02:02"

But I think what we appreciate the most about Noah is his use of Life Skills during group and partnership activities.&nbsp;He is always willing to share tasks, listen to his friends' ideas, and collaborate in order to complete an assignment.&nbsp; He is such a genuinely kind person and it makes teaching him a joy. Noah is doing a great job in science so far and we look forward to working with him again after the Winter Break.</p>
